# 🧬📚 Fine-tuning Google Gemma Models on Custom Data

This project demonstrates how to **fine-tune Google Gemma models** using a domain-specific dataset. It includes a complete training pipeline implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook**, showcasing how to adapt pre-trained LLMs for specialized tasks such as customer support, healthcare Q&A, or legal analysis.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
Finetuning With Custom Data Using Google Gemma Models/
└── Gemma_Finetuning_notebook.ipynb    # Notebook with training + evaluation
```

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🏗️ Prepares and tokenizes custom dataset for fine-tuning
- ⚙️ Fine-tunes a Gemma LLM with LoRA/PEFT or full fine-tuning (as applicable)
- 📈 Tracks training/validation loss and evaluation metrics
- 🧪 In-notebook inferencing on sample prompts

---

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter, Colab, or VS Code
2. Make sure the dataset path and model checkpoint are updated
3. Run cells sequentially to train, evaluate, and test

> ⚠️ Ensure your environment supports `transformers`, `peft`, and `accelerate`. For larger models, GPU runtime is recommended.
